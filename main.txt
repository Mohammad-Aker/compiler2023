## Dummy code example in COMP2023

## Define some variables
program var constant integer bool string float true false if fi then else while do od and or read write for from to by := + - * / = != < <= > >= . ; [] , { }

## Assign values to variables
A_Funny33COMP2023dentifier = 42
x = -10
z101 = 3.14
dog = "a cute animal"
DoG = "not the same as 'dog'"

## Implement a simple loop
from = 1
to = 10
by = 2

for i := from to by do
    write i
od

## Output: 1 3 5 7 9

## Nested if-else statements
if x > 0 then
    y := 1
else
    y := -1
fi

## Read input and perform calculations
read input_integer
input_float := 3.14
result := (input_integer + input_float) * x

## String manipulation
str1 = "Hello,"
str2 = " World!"
concatenated_string := str1 + str2

## Output: "Hello, World!"
